Hello, my name is Lucas Magalhães and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at PUC Minas. I'm also proud to hold a B2 level Cambridge certificate, which demonstrates my proficiency in the English language. I'm passionate about learning and continuously strive to expand my knowledge in this field. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am eager to contribute my skills to any project or team I work with.
